#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
        

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   
answer: software engineering is the proces of building reliable and user friendly softwares that solve real world problems.
        It enables development of systems, application, drives innovation and helps to ensure the reliability and security of a software systemm or application.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   
answer: the development of waterfall methodology that facilitate developments of software in phases
        agile methodology which is more flexible which developmet is done in sprints.

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

answer: Planning- this involves gathering all requirements based on what the software will do.
        Design - Creating the blueprint for how it will work.
        Development. Actual coding of the software system.
        Testing - Making sure everything works as expected and all errors are fixed.
        Deployment - the software is released into the market.
        Maintenance - Updating and fixing any errors that might arise.

3. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   
answer: waterfall methodology is a step by step software development where the first phase must be completed before moving to the next phase while
         agile methodology is more flexible as updates can be done on software developed in previsous phase unlike in waterfall where its difficult to make updates to 
          software built in the previous phase.
        example: waterfall in construction software and medical device software as the requirements are specific and they do not change often.
                 agile is e commerce site as changes can be made any time when users request them.

4. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   
answer: software developers are responsible for the actual coding where they transform designs into software products.
        Quality assurance engineer are responsible for ensuring that software meets the set standards and it is error free and operates as expected.
        project mangers are responsible for handling any issues that arise and also keep the team on track to ensure that deadlines are meet.

5. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   
answer: IDEs are important as they make coding easier and faster example is visual studion code which provides an environment for developers to write codes.
        VCS used to facilitate collaboration between developers and also allow developers to track chenges made to codes example is git.

6. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   
answer: testing and debugging - testing should be started early in the development process as fixing bugs when the software is fully developed can be costly compared to ficing while developing.
        complex problem - the problem can be broken down into different parts and each part addressed at a time. like a software system can be developed one component at a time.


7. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   
answer : unit testing - this is where individual software components are tested seoparately.
         integration testing - this is where testing is done on components that have been integrated to ensure they are compatible and are functioning as expected.
         system testing - this is where the entire system is tested.
         acceptance testing - this testing is done to test whether the software meets the end user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   
answer: prompt engineering - this is the process to giving instructions by creating clear and specific questions for an AI to get the best responses.
        - it is efficient as it provides immediate feedback.
        - it helps in problem solving as the AI is directed to think in the way one wants by giving clear and precise instructions.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   
answer: vague prompt - write some products idea.
                      suggest some  uniques product that are eco friedly and for schooluse.
